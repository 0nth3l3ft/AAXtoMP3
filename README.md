# AAXtoMP3
The purpose of this software is to convert AAX files to a more common MP3 format.

Audible uses this file format to maintain DRM restrictions on their audio
books and if you download your book through your library it will be
stored in this format.

The purpose of this software is **not** to circumvent the DRM restrictions
for audio books that **you** do not own in that you do not have them on
your **personal** Audible account. The purpose of this software is to
create a method for you to download and store your books just in case
Audible fails for some reason.

## Setup
You will need your four byte authitication code that comes from Audible's
servers. This will be used by ffmpeg to perform the initial audio convert. You
can obtain this string from a tool like [audible-activator](https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator).

## Anti-Piracy Notice

Note that this project does NOT ‘crack’ the DRM. It simplys allows the user to
use their own encryption key (fetched from Audible servers) to decrypt the
audiobook in the same manner that the official audiobook playing software does.

Please only use this application for gaining full access to your own audiobooks
for archiving/converson/convenience. DeDRMed audiobooks should not be uploaded
to open servers, torrents, or other methods of mass distribution. No help will
be given to people doing such things. Authors, retailers, and publishers all
need to make a living, so that they can continue to produce audiobooks for us to
hear, and enjoy. Don’t be a parasite.
